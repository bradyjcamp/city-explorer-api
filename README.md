# City Explorer API

**Author**: Brady Camp
**Version**: 1.8.0

## Overview

This application is the server for City Explorer. It will import information from the weatherbit API and others to the main app.

## Getting Started

- The first step was to create a very simple whiteboard drawing of what the web request-response cycle(WRRC) would look like.
  - [WRRC 1](/city-explorer-LocationIQ-API.jpg)
  - [WRRC 2](/city-explorer-server-API.jpg)
  - [WRRC 3](/city-explorer-wrrc.jpg)
  - [WRRC 4](/WRRC.png)
- Then create a new repo and include configs such as .gitignore, .eslintrc.json.
- After that, import appropriate data and dependencies including weather.json file and data, and express, dotenv, and cors using `npm install`

## Architecture

- Whiteboard created using Miro.
- This application includes JSX, React Bootstrap, express, dotenv, CORS and weatherbit API
